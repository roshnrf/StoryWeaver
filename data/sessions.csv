“Oh!” she squeaked. She found a big, shiny pebble. “This can be **a phone**!”

She held the pebble up to her ear. *Ring-ring!* “Hello, Grandma Squirrel?”

A tiny ant walked by and waved. Lilly put the pebble down. Then she picked up a pink flower.

“Maybe this is a better phone,” she thought. “It is **a phone** that smells nice!”

She called her teddy bear next. ""Are you having fun?"" she whispered into the petals. It was exciting to use her imagination. Every pebble and flower could be **a phone** for a very important call!"

He decided his best friend needed one too. ""When you play, you can pretend **you have a phone** also!"" he said. Toby told the rainbow good morning. It was wonderful to **have a phone** for magical calls!"

Sue tilted her head. She had fluff in her ear. “Wait, wait! **What are you saying**?” Sue asked kindly.

Pip giggled and spoke louder. “I said I saw a rainbow berry! It was shiny!”

Sue smiled big. “Oh, that sounds amazing! Can you tell me again **what you are saying** about the berry?” (She was practicing her listening!)

Pip took a big breath. He used his big, clear voice this time.

Sue heard every word! They both felt good about understanding **what they were saying** to each other. Talking is fun when you listen carefully!"

The sun was shining bright! Dash saw his favorite purple butterfly flutter by.

“I want to catch you!” he whispered.

“Time to **run**!” Dash barked happily. He stretched his paws and dashed across the soft green grass.

His friend Leo the rabbit wiggled his nose. “Wait for me! I can **run** fast too!”

They ran past the flowers and around the swing set. The butterfly giggled and landed on a big daisy.

Dash and Leo stopped next to it. It was so much fun to **run**! They gave each other high-fives and took a big, happy rest."

What he **saw** was a fluffy bunny practicing a wonderful **habit**. The bunny was putting all her crayons back in the box!

""That's a super tidy **habit**,"" Pip squeaked happily.

Then, Pip tiptoed further. He **saw** a sleepy badger making his bed. ""Another great **habit**!"" Pip cheered. Good **habits** help make the world bright and fun. Pip smiled and decided to start a new **habit** too: always jumping high when he woke up!"
